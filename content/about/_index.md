Hi my name is Philip Kristoffersen. I'm a father and programmer that occasionally makes programming things in my spare time.
I currently work from home for [Brølstærk](http://broelstaerk.dk/) but what I write about in this blog, the content and opinions, are my own.
If you read this blog you will find that i get really interested in neice things and deep dive and the way I learn is by doing.

I have decided to start this blog to share with the world my findings, and remember all the fun things I have worked on throughout the years.

Currently I am making games from scratch in Rust.

You can reach me on twitter [@PhKristoffersen](https://twitter.com/PhKristoffersen).
