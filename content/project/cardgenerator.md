Based on your BGG collection generate some playingcards.

This was basicly the analog predeceser to Cardboard Butler. The idea was that instaed of pulling down all your boardgames from your shelf, you would just pull out the deck of card, and each card would give a breif introduction to the game.
I ended up actually making this work, with canvas, and a pdf generator in the browser. I got the cards printet, cut, and then when i tried it out with a group, they kind of just looked at me and said "i don't know, can you just pick one?".
Lessons learned:

* Comsumer overload is real.
* Test your ideas before you spend many hours pusing pixels around on a canvas just to realized that the idea is flawed.
