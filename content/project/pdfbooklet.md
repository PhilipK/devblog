I once in a while like to play Tabletop RPGs, if you have ever tried any of them you know that the rulebooks for those games can easily be a couple hundred pages. I normally buy my books digitally, but there are some games that are just nice to have in physical copies. I thought about printing them, but the environmentalist in me could not justify printing 300 pages.

I looked at how books are bound, if you look close you can see that books are a collection of small booklets bound together. About 8 pages, folded in the middle, and bound or sown together.
Then each of these booklets are bound together.

I made a small program that takes a pdf, and organizes the pages for printing in this fashion. A new pdf is made so that by printing on both sides of the paper, you can fit 4 pages onto on paper.
