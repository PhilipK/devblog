A prototype for a Factory Builder VR game.

In 2016 I had just got a HTC Vive, VR was here! Also I got Factorio, and I wanted to combine the two. 
The idea was simple, build machines in 3d in vr, process resources with machines and put then into other machines.

I think the reason I gave up on this project was Unity, any time I use unity i feel like I spend 30% of the time programming the game, and 70% looking up how to actually do something right in Unity. I had the first little prototype with conveyer belts, machines and resources working, but decided to shelf the game. Maybe I will come back to the idea now that I have an Oculus Quest 2.
