A simple rendering of your BGG games using ELM.

ELM was a pretty interesting language. I am always drawn to strict languages, that in return promises safety and reliablitiy, and I can say that ELM delivers on those tings. Would I make a new project in ELM now? No, probably not, but I can say that it had changed the way that i think about programming, and it lead me to the next languages. I just made a couple of small projects with ELM, so i am not sure how it scales. The biggest downside to ELM at the time for me was that I realized that I probably could not convince anyone that it is a great language, it was just too functional and strict for most of my collegaues.
