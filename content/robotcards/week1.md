## Finishing a game

I am going to finish a game. I have always wanted to make a game, and I have started making many, but I have never really finish finished a game.
So here is the goal. By *September 9th 2021*, I am going to release a game, of some size and some way (hoping for a Steam release, but let's see).
I made a bet with my wife that I could do it, so now I really have to do it!

I have 26 weeks!

## What is the game

Right now the game is codenamed "Robot Cards". Because that is what I know, it is about progamming robots, using cards. The gameplay is inspired by some of my favorite games like :

* Roborally (Boardgame)
* Into the Breach
* Hades
* Slay the spire
* Dominion (Boardgame)

The gameplay might change a lot as the weeks go on, but for now the core idea is that you:
Have a board
