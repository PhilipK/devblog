<p><p>Hi my name is Philip Kristoffersen. I'm a father and programmer that occasionally makes programming things in my spare time.
I currently work from home for <a href="http://broelstaerk.dk/">Brølstærk</a> but what I write about in this blog, the content and opinions, are my own.
If you read this blog you will find that i get really interested in neice things and deep dive and the way I learn is by doing.</p>
<p>I have decided to start this blog to share with the world my findings, and remember all the fun things I have worked on throughout the years.</p>
<p>Currently I am making games from scratch in Rust.</p>
<p>You can reach me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/PhKristoffersen">@PhKristoffersen</a>.</p>
