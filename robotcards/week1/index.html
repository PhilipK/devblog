<p><h2 id="finishing-a-game">Finishing a game</h2>
<p>I am going to finish a game. I have always wanted to make a game, and I have started making many, but I have never really finish finished a game.
So here is the goal. By <em>September 9th 2021</em>, I am going to release a game, of some size and some way (hoping for a Steam release, but let's see).
I made a bet with my wife that I could do it, so now I really have to do it!</p>
<p>I have 26 weeks!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-game">What is the game</h2>
<p>Right now the game is codenamed &quot;Robot Cards&quot;. Because that is what I know, it is about progamming robots, using cards. The gameplay is inspired by some of my favorite games like :</p>
<ul>
<li>Roborally (Boardgame)</li>
<li>Into the Breach</li>
<li>Hades</li>
<li>Slay the spire</li>
<li>Dominion (Boardgame)</li>
</ul>
<p>The gameplay might change a lot as the weeks go on, but for now the core idea is that you:
You control robots on a board/grid.
Each robot has a set of &quot;registers&quot; that can contain actions they can perform.
You &quot;program&quot; the robots by playing cards on a register.
After the planning the robots will perform the actions one by one.
Robots can push and attack each other.</p>
<p>The game is a rougelike, and deckbuilder, meaning that you get to change the cards you have available after each scenario. If you loose you start over and have to build a new deck (but you can unlock new cards options for your deck).</p>
<p>Also //TODO, i need to work on this elevator pitch.</p>
<h2 id="the-process">The process</h2>
<p>The plan is to make a weekly update on what has been made since last week, and to talk about what I will make for the next week.
To anyone reading this (including future me), congratulations you are my accountability partner.</p>
<p>I might make video updates aswell, once I have something that is actually worth showing on video :-)</p>
<p>Each week i will make one of theese post, then plan the next week (I am using Trello for planning). If I during the day get a good idea i add it to a &quot;scratchpad&quot; list in Trello and each week I will then organize and revisit the items.</p>
<p>I will try to do a &quot;sprint planning&quot; each week, to try and keep focus for the week. Also I am trying to keep track of time, since I only have 26 weeks.</p>
<p>I have 3 kids and a dayjob, so I only have about an hour each day to work on this project, maybe if I am lucky a bit more on weekends. Lets say 10 hours a week, that leaves me with 260 hours to make this game.... that is not a lot for a game from scratch. SO I really have to keep focus.</p>
<p>Each week I have to answer two questions:</p>
<p>What is fun about this game? and what is not?</p>
<h2 id="tech">Tech</h2>
<p>I will be making this game in Rust, using SDL2 for input and output and Legion ECS as an ECS library, but besides that the rest will be handmade. I am not using Unity or Unreal, because I want to learn how to do all the steps of the game development process.</p>
<h2 id="week-1">Week 1</h2>
<p>This first week, I have gotten started, I have a basic grid, units can move, they can be programmed, you have a deck of cards, a hand and a discard pile. There is currently only one goal for the enemy, and that is to get the goal area. I got A star implemented, so there is a &quot;game&quot;, as you can see from the screenshot, there is a long way to go.</p>
<h2 id="next-week">Next Week</h2>
<p>During play testing I found that the game was pretty hard, the way I have implemented the player registers, each card has a priorty, that is pretty hard to keep track of. Maybe i will just let each unit have a priority instead, or atleast make it clearer what is going to happen. Next week I will focus on getting the game easier to play, because it is needed to handle  randomness of the cards you are given. </p>
