<p class="subtitle"><strong>2021-04-25</strong></p>

 

<p><h2 id="progress-this-week">Progress this week</h2>
<p>This week I didn't have much time to work on the project (family and work took all my free time), but I did get a few things done.</p>
<p>First I got to plan out everything that is needed for the first &quot;friends shareable alpha&quot;. Meaning, I have set a goal that in two weeks, I need to have a playable build, that is finish enough that I can get feedback from a few close friends. 
There are quite a few things that needs fixed before that.</p>
<p>I also got to implement a few more cards and abilities, and I have made the abilities code a lot more generic (so that it is easier to implement abilities).</p>
<p>Currently I am also working on redoing how fonts are rendered. SDL2 font rendering has always been a problem for me, so instead I am redoing by just using a texture generated from a font, that contains one of each character i need. Then I can use the sprite batch to render one character at a time.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-fun">What is fun?</h2>
<p>The new cards and abilities show that it is going to be fun.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-not-fun">What is not fun?</h2>
<p>Same as last week: You can still only play one level, and there are no rewards for finising a level.</p>
<h2 id="next-week">Next week</h2>
<p>Same as last week: Working on playing more than one level, and getting rewards inbetween.</p>
