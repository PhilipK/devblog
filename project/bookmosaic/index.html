<h1 class="title">Book Mosaic</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2020-06-08</strong></p>


<a href="https://github.com/PhilipK/Rust_mosaic">Code</a>
 

<p><p>Generates a &quot;mosaic&quot; of a collection of images.</p>
<h2 id="3-iterations">3 Iterations</h2>
<p>This is one of those projects that have been through quite some iterations, I have reimplemented this at least 3 times. So if the listed &quot;tags&quot; at for this project looks a little weird, it is because it is actually 3 projects, at 3 different times, all doing about the same.</p>
<h2 id="why-make-this">Why make this?</h2>
<p>I like to read books, I exclusively read digital books on my Kindle. I try to read a book a week, but that is not always possible, so maybe about 40 books a year. One thing that I realize that I miss is having a book shelf, a place to display my books. I don't want the shelf to show off (look how well read I am) but more to keep the books as memorabilia. Something you walk by, and then, out of the corner of your eye, you glimpse the cover of a great book and then instantly remember all of those great moments from the book.</p>
<p>So the idea was &quot;how about I make a mosaic of all the covers of all the books I have read and put that as the lock screen on my computer&quot;
Also the image should update every time I have finished reading a book (which I track on GoodReads).</p>
<h2 id="the-algorithm">The Algorithm</h2>
<p>The Algorithm for this mosaic goes something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find out the resolution of the target image</li>
<li>Decide on a number of columns you want (iteration 1 this was manual, in 2 and 3 it is automatic)</li>
<li>Resize all images to the with of the column (keeping the aspect ratio)</li>
<li>Go through each image and add it to the &quot;lowest column&quot;, updating the height of the column</li>
</ul>
<p>This will make an image that looks something like this:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilipK/hobbyportfolio/main/static/images/mosaic.png" alt="Mosaic Image" /></p>
<p>The trick here is to find the best number of columns, each iteration had a separate way of handling this.</p>
<h2 id="iteration-1-c-typescript-canvas">Iteration 1 - C#, Typescript &amp; Canvas</h2>
<p>The first iteration of this was done in a simple typescript webpage. Canvas was used to draw the images. Integration with Goodreads was done through the Goodreads API and some C# code.
The interface was an input field for your Goodreads id, a number input for the number of columns you wanted and a subtmit button to go.</p>
<p>The solution worked.... kind of, I ran into this weird problem with Canvas.
If you are using images from a different origin (a different DNS domain) the canvas will be concidered &quot;unsafe&quot; and you can now not easily download the canvas as an image.
It is possible to get around this with a &quot;no cors proxy&quot; but that just made the whole solution very unreliable. 
Another problem was that the solution was slow, and the whole browser would freeze up for a while when making the image.
But, it worked well enough for awhile.</p>
<h2 id="iteration-2-docker-dotnet-core">Iteration 2 - Docker &amp; DotNet Core</h2>
<p>Later I was learning about docker containers, and thought of a rewrite of this project into c# with a library for the image. The plan was to run a docker container on my local machine that would check for new book images, store the images locally and then generate the new mosaic and store it on disk.
I got it working no problem, the c# version was much faster than the javascript one, and getting a dotnet core application running in a container was super simple.
Since this solution was faster and running in the background, i could make a best guess at how many columns where needed, but simply trying columns = n / 2 (where n is the number of pictures) and then iterating backwords (n--) until i had an image where all columns where not full, when i would make the final image with n+1. This worked pretty well, it was ofc slower than just typing the columns myself.</p>
<p>But there where still problems.
I could not really automately set the lockscreen (i couldn't do that in the first solution either), running a whole Hyper VM for just one docker image.
I ended up turning off the container, and just running the program and setting the lockscreen manullly every time i finished a book.</p>
<h2 id="iteration-3-rust-rayon">Iteration 3 - Rust &amp; Rayon</h2>
<p>Enter Rust, 2020 (or the later half of 2020 and 2021 so far) has been the year of Rust for me. I wanted to learn about about image proccessing and multi threading in rust.
The new implementation was surprisingly simple compared to both the C# and Javascript version, that might be because it was the 3rd time i was implementing this.
The solution was about 5x faster than the C# version, but the kicker was that now, instead of calculating the number of columns one at a time i could parralize that with Rayon. Instead i could now look at how many wasted pixel i had (pixels from the books not in the final mosaic or pixels not fill out in the final mosaic).
For this solution is just made a CLI, added it to Windows path, and used a little powershell script to run the cli, and then set the windows lockscreen. I triggered the powershell script to run every time i log into the machine.
In the end this solution is the first one that could automate it all... without even spinning up hyper-v vm for docker :-)</p>
