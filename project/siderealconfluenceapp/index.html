<p><p>Sidereal Confluence board game helper app, written in Angular.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-up-with-the-angular">Keeping up with the Angular</h2>
<p>Back when Angular first came out I tried using it, and it was fine, but then I found React and it just spoke to me a lot more.
But I know that it Angular is very popular and very used, so it can be good to revisit something you initially dismissed.
I wanted to make a small helper app for the boardgame Sidereal Confluence, there is a bit of setup in that game, and you have to keep track of the round number and you need a timer, I thought it was a small enough app to test out the state of Angular.</p>
<h2 id="observables-are-interesting">Observables are interesting</h2>
<p>One thing that I think I like is the concept of Observabe, just subscribe and you will get new data. This is a lot of what happens in the web world, we render data. When that data changes we need to render again. What I don't know is how hard this is to track, I have a feeling this could end up leading to a  &quot;why did it change now?&quot;  or a &quot;why didn't it update&quot;
moment.</p>
<h2 id="i-still-prefer-other-frameworks">I still prefer other frameworks</h2>
<p>Look, Angular is fine, if I am forced to use it I will gladly do that, it is the worst of the best for me, that doesn't make it bad. But for me, I will still try to use something else.
Angular still is opinionated about a lot of things, and has a lot of things out of the box, I just still feel like i spend most of the time debuggin why my angular code does not work, rather than writing the code. </p>
