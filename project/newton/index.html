<p><p>This was my first game written in Rust, and the first game I have actually finished.
You play as a spaceship that has to reach a goal before time runs out, without hitting other objects. The kicker is that there is only gravity near big objects, so you have to deal with not flying &quot;too fast&quot; and overshooting your target.</p>

<p>I hat watched this video:</p>

<p>And the idea of ECS really inspired me, I also thought that a game was a good project for learning some more Rust.</p>
<h2 id="amethyst">Amethyst</h2>
<p>Amethyst is a game engine for Rust, and it seemed to be one of the more stable ones out there. The docs are nice and you can get started quickly. But i quickly faced the same problem I always face with Unity, I had to spend more time figuring out how to use the engine than actually programming the game itself. Also, Amethyst did at the time not support mobile targets, and I thought that if I had to learn an engine it should probably support phones.
I decided to test the waters with Amethyst and then move on to something else later.</p>
<h2 id="finishing-a-game">Finishing a game</h2>
<p>I had set a goal for myself that I needed a playable games, including a titlescreen, gameplay, scoreboard, music and sound. In the end i got all those things to work, but I must admit that I underestimated how long it takes to get all the &quot;not real gameplay&quot; code done.</p>
