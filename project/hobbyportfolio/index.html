<p><p>Using a static site generator to make this webpage, uses <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a></p>
<h2 id="the-hobby-project-graveyard">The hobby project graveyard</h2>
<p>I think that a lot of programmers have a long list of projects that they have started and never finihsed. I am no exception. But for every project I make I learn something, and I do make cool stuff, even if it is just for me. I realized that instead of &quot;being ashames of not finishing things&quot; I should be happy and proud that I keep learning new things. This page is a tribute to those &quot;fallen heroes/projects&quot;. Hopefully readers can learn something from my mistakes, but even if they don't I can atleast look back on my old projects with foundness and pride.</p>
<h2 id="static-site-generator">Static Site Generator</h2>
<p>To make this page I looked into a couple of different technologies. I knew that the page needed very little interaction, and mainly was just going to be &quot;blog posts&quot;. I had heard of static site generators and looked at what was available. Initially Gatsby looked interesting, but it was maybe a bit overkill, so I looked at alternatives. I heard about <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a> on a podcast and gave it a shot.</p>
<h2 id="zola">Zola</h2>
<p>It does a few things, but it does them very well, and very fast. All I needed was a way to generate html, in a reliable fashion, and Zola does that. Initally I also looked into the Theming, but realized that I need almost no CSS to get something that is good enough. The end result is that I can not generate this whole page in a couple of miliseconds locally to test. For deployment I set up github actions, and for hosting I set up a github page. All in all, completely free hosting and deployment in a couple of seconds.</p>
<p>I am very happy with the result, if you have a small business page or blog I can recommend Zola!</p>
